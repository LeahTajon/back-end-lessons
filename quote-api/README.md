# QUOTE API

## Back-end Developement Project

### Overview

This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you'll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fullfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily resolve.

### Project Goals
In this project, you'll be building a small Express.js web API to store and serve different quotes about computers, coding, and technology.
